Here I mainly used the different types of properties in CSS.
- rotateY() function plays a vital role here, because it needs to rotate vertically for 180deg on hover on parent class.
- Making the parent position as relative and child positions as absolute will make them align one after another.
- Definitely, without transform-style as preserve-3d, we can't make the animations in 3D perspective.
